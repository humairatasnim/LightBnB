# LightBnB
A simple multi-page AirBnB clone that uses server-side JavaScript to display the information from queries to web pages via SQL queries.

In this project, I built the back-end queries that allow users to search for accommodations in an online travel app. I connected to a PostgreSQL database using Node's postgres library and wrote the queries that deliver the right data to the front-end.
