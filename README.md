# LightBnB
A simple multi-page AirBnB clone that uses server-side JavaScript to display the information from queries to web pages via SQL queries.

In this project, I built the back-end queries that allow users to search for accommodations in an online travel app. I connected to a PostgreSQL database using Node's postgres library and wrote the queries that deliver the right data to the front-end.

## Getting Started
1. Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
2. Start the web server (using the `npm run local` command).
3. In your browser, go to http://localhost:3000/.
